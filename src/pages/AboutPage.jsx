          <p>
            Hi, I'm Ehsan Mosaddeghi, a soon-to-be computer science student at
            the University of Tabriz, Iran. As a tech enthusiast, I'm excited to
            dive into the world of coding and software development.

          <h2>A Bit About My Background</h2>
          <p>
            Growing up in Tabriz, I've always been fascinated by technology and
            its endless possibilities. I've spent countless hours honing my
            skills, exploring new programming languages, and experimenting with
            innovative projects. When I'm not studying or working, you can find
            me immersed in a good book, watching a thought-provoking movie, or
            listening to insightful podcasts.

          <h2>My Journey as a Frontend Developer</h2>
          <p>
            My fascination with frontend development began when I was just 16. I
            discovered that I had a creative streak and a passion for working
            with design and colors. As I delved deeper into the world of coding,
            I realized that frontend development was the perfect blend of art
            and technology. I found myself drawn to the idea of bringing designs
            to life, creating interactive experiences, and making a visual
            impact. It was then that I knew I wanted to pursue a career in
            frontend development, and I've been hooked ever since!
